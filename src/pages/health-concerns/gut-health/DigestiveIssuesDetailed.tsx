  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "What causes digestive issues?",
      answer: "Digestive issues can arise from multiple factors including dietary habits (high-fat foods, processed foods, excessive caffeine), stress and anxiety which affect the gut-brain axis, imbalances in gut microbiome, food intolerances (lactose, gluten, FODMAPs), certain medications (antibiotics, NSAIDs), infections (bacterial, viral, parasitic), and underlying conditions like IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise, inadequate sleep, and smoking can also contribute to digestive dysfunction."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for homeopathic remedies to work for digestive problems?",
      answer: "The timeline varies based on whether the condition is acute or chronic. For acute digestive issues like sudden indigestion or bloating, homeopathic remedies may provide relief within hours to a few days. For chronic conditions like IBS or long-standing digestive discomfort, improvement typically occurs over 2-4 weeks, with full benefits often seen after 2-3 months of consistent treatment. Constitutional homeopathic treatment addresses root causes and may take longer but provides more lasting results. Individual response varies based on the severity of symptoms, overall health, and adherence to treatment and lifestyle modifications."
    },
    {
      question: "Can homeopathy cure IBS permanently?",
      answer: "Homeopathy takes a holistic approach to IBS, aiming to address the underlying imbalances rather than just suppressing symptoms. Many patients experience significant long-term improvement and even complete resolution of symptoms through constitutional homeopathic treatment combined with lifestyle modifications. However, IBS is a complex functional disorder influenced by multiple factors including stress, diet, and gut microbiome. Homeopathy can help restore digestive balance, reduce symptom frequency and severity, and improve quality of life. The success rate varies individually, and some patients may require ongoing management. A personalized treatment approach with an experienced homeopath yields the best outcomes."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there side effects of homeopathic digestive remedies?",
      answer: "Homeopathic remedies are generally very safe and well-tolerated with minimal risk of side effects when taken as prescribed. They are prepared through a process of dilution and succussion, making them gentle even for children, pregnant women, and elderly patients. Occasionally, some patients may experience a temporary worsening of symptoms (called a homeopathic aggravation) before improvement begins, which is usually mild and short-lived. Unlike conventional medications, homeopathic remedies do not cause dependence, do not interact harmfully with other medications, and do not burden the digestive system further. However, it's important to take remedies under professional guidance for optimal results and proper dosage."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take homeopathic remedies with my regular medication?",
      answer: "Yes, homeopathic remedies can generally be taken alongside conventional medications safely. There are no known harmful interactions between homeopathic medicines and pharmaceutical drugs. However, it's recommended to maintain a 30-minute gap between taking homeopathic remedies and other medications or food. If you're on prescription medications for digestive conditions, continue them as advised by your doctor and inform both your doctor and homeopath about all medications you're taking. As your digestive health improves with homeopathic treatment, your doctor may gradually reduce conventional medications under proper supervision. Never discontinue prescribed medications without consulting your healthcare provider."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best homeopathic remedy for bloating?",
      answer: "There is no single 'best' remedy for bloating as homeopathy follows the principle of individualization - the right remedy depends on your specific symptoms, triggers, and overall constitution. Common remedies for bloating include: Carbo Vegetabilis (for severe bloating with gas, worse after eating, feeling of fullness), Lycopodium (for bloating especially in lower abdomen, worse 4-8 PM, craving sweets), China Officinalis (for bloating with no relief from belching, after eating fruits), Nux Vomica (for bloating after overeating, rich foods, or alcohol), and Pulsatilla (for bloating after fatty foods, changeable symptoms). A qualified homeopath will assess your complete symptom picture to prescribe the most suitable remedy for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I prevent digestive issues?",
      answer: "Prevention involves multiple lifestyle strategies: eat mindfully by chewing thoroughly and avoiding rushed meals; maintain regular meal times; stay adequately hydrated with 8-10 glasses of water daily; include fiber-rich foods gradually; consume probiotic foods like yogurt and fermented vegetables; limit processed foods, excessive caffeine, and alcohol; identify and avoid personal trigger foods using a food diary; manage stress through yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises; exercise regularly (30 minutes daily); ensure 7-9 hours of quality sleep; avoid eating 2-3 hours before bedtime; don't smoke; and maintain good posture while eating. Regular health check-ups can help detect issues early."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I avoid certain foods while taking homeopathic treatment?",
      answer: "While taking homeopathic remedies, it's advisable to avoid strong-smelling or strong-tasting substances that might antidote the remedies. Avoid coffee, mint (including toothpaste with mint), camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus products at least 30 minutes before and after taking your remedy. These substances can potentially interfere with the action of homeopathic medicines. Apart from these, you don't need to follow strict dietary restrictions unless specifically advised by your homeopath based on your condition. However, for digestive issues, it's beneficial to avoid known trigger foods like spicy, fried, or processed foods, excessive dairy if lactose intolerant, and foods that cause gas or discomfort."
    },
    {
      question: "Can children take homeopathic remedies for digestive problems?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Homeopathic remedies are safe and effective for children of all ages, including infants. They are particularly suitable for children because they are gentle, have no side effects, and don't cause drowsiness or affect concentration. Common pediatric digestive issues treated with homeopathy include colic, constipation, diarrhea, teething-related digestive upset, food sensitivities, and stomach aches. The dosage is adjusted based on the child's age and weight. Remedies can be dissolved in water for easy administration to infants and young children. Many parents prefer homeopathy for their children's digestive complaints as it supports the body's natural healing without suppressing symptoms."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between functional and organic digestive disorders?",
      answer: "Functional digestive disorders (like IBS, functional dyspepsia, non-ulcer dyspepsia) occur when the digestive system doesn't work properly despite having no visible structural damage or disease on tests. Symptoms are real but medical tests appear normal. These conditions involve problems with gut-brain communication, motility, or visceral hypersensitivity. Organic digestive disorders (like ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease, gallstones, pancreatitis) involve visible structural changes, inflammation, or damage that can be detected through endoscopy, imaging, or lab tests. Homeopathy is particularly effective for functional disorders, addressing the underlying imbalance. For organic disorders, homeopathy can serve as valuable complementary treatment alongside conventional medical care."

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      Bloating is characterized by an uncomfortable feeling of fullness and tightness in the abdomen, often accompanied by visible swelling. This occurs when excess gas accumulates in the digestive system or when the digestive process slows down. Bloating typically worsens after meals, particularly following consumption of high-fiber foods, fatty or greasy meals, carbonated beverages, or foods you're sensitive to. Many people describe it as feeling like their stomach is stretched or inflated like a balloon. The discomfort can range from mild to severe and may be accompanied by a gurgling sensation.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      Digestive pain manifests in various forms - sharp, stabbing pains, dull aches, or cramping sensations that come in waves. The location of pain provides clues about its source: upper abdominal pain often relates to stomach issues like gastritis or indigestion, lower abdominal pain may indicate intestinal problems, and pain around the navel can suggest small intestine involvement. Pain patterns vary significantly - some experience constant discomfort, while others have intermittent cramping. Common triggers include eating certain foods, stress, hormonal changes (particularly in women), and irregular eating patterns. The intensity can range from mild discomfort to severe pain that interferes with daily activities.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      Bowel irregularity is one of the most common digestive complaints. Constipation involves having fewer than three bowel movements per week, passing hard or lumpy stools, experiencing excessive straining, or feeling of incomplete evacuation. This can cause abdominal discomfort, bloating, and reduced appetite. Conversely, diarrhea involves frequent loose or watery stools, often accompanied by urgency and cramping. Some individuals experience alternating patterns - periods of constipation followed by diarrhea - which is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Normal bowel frequency varies from person to person, but any significant change from your usual pattern warrants attention.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      Excessive gas production and passage (flatulence) is both uncomfortable and socially distressing. Gas can be trapped in the digestive system, causing sharp, stabbing pains that move around the abdomen and may even be mistaken for heart problems when occurring in the upper left abdomen. Belching (burping) occurs when gas is released from the upper digestive tract, often due to swallowing air while eating or drinking. Intestinal gas results from bacterial fermentation of undigested food in the colon and is released as flatulence. While passing gas 10-20 times daily is normal, excessive or foul-smelling gas may indicate digestive issues, food intolerances, or gut microbiome imbalances.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                      Indigestion refers to discomfort or burning sensation in the upper abdomen, typically occurring during or shortly after eating. Symptoms include a feeling of uncomfortable fullness even after eating small amounts (early satiety), burning or gnawing sensation in the stomach area, acid reflux where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus causing heartburn, and nausea. Indigestion can be triggered by overeating, eating too quickly, consuming rich, fatty, or spicy foods, drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages, or stress and anxiety. Some people experience chronic indigestion without any identifiable cause, known as functional dyspepsia.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Digestive issues are classified as acute (sudden onset, lasting days to weeks) or chronic (persistent or recurring over months to years). Acute digestive problems often result from dietary indiscretion, food poisoning, viral gastroenteritis, or temporary stress. Chronic digestive issues suggest underlying conditions like IBS, chronic gastritis, food intolerances, or functional digestive disorders. Symptom patterns vary significantly - some experience constant daily symptoms, others have episodic flare-ups with symptom-free periods, and many notice cyclical patterns related to menstrual cycles, stress levels, seasonal changes, or dietary variations. Understanding your symptom pattern helps in diagnosis and treatment planning.

                <AlertDescription className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                  Homeopathic treatment is particularly effective for functional digestive disorders (IBS, functional dyspepsia), chronic bloating and gas, mild to moderate indigestion and acid reflux, stress-related digestive issues, and as complementary treatment alongside conventional care for various digestive conditions. After ruling out serious organic diseases, homeopathy offers gentle, natural solutions that address root causes rather than just suppressing symptoms.

                  Homeopathic treatment for digestive issues focuses on stimulating the body's natural healing mechanisms to restore digestive balance. Unlike conventional treatments that often suppress symptoms, homeopathy works to correct underlying imbalances in digestive function, gut motility, and the gut-brain connection.

                    The selection of the right homeopathic remedy depends on your individual symptom picture, personality, and overall health status. A qualified homeopath considers not just your digestive symptoms but also your emotional state, stress levels, food preferences, and general constitution to prescribe the most suitable remedy and potency. Self-treatment with over-the-counter homeopathic remedies may help acute symptoms, but constitutional treatment from a professional homeopath provides best long-term results for chronic digestive issues.
